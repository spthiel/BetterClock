# BetterClock

Plugin for BetterDiscord which sizes the window down and adds a Clock to the side.

# How to edit:

Download [BetterClock.theme.js](https://github.com/spthiel/BetterClock/blob/master/BetterClock.theme.css)
and edit the values inside that theme.

# For best experience:

Use a theme with transparent background like [Transparency by Infiniti](https://github.com/mashirochan/Mashiro-chan/blob/master/transparency.theme.css) or set the background to `transparent` and add the background url to the theme above.

Also just want to remind you: You can use gifs as background.
