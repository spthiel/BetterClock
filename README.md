# BetterClock

Plugin for BetterDiscord which sizes the window down and adds a Clock to the side.
Use 
```css
:root{
  --Background-image: url(<url>);
}
``` 
to set a different background.

```css
#clocktime{
  /* css code */
}
```
can be used to modify the appereance of the Time
```css
#clockdate{
  /* css code */
}
```
can be used to modify the date display
and finally
```css
#clockline{
  /* css code */
}
```
can be used to edit the line in the center

# For best experience:

Use a theme with transparent background or set the background to `transparent` and add the background url to the root as described at the top.

Also just want to remind you: You can use gifs as background.
